## initial version.
Circuit that has everything you need to assemble your mClon-style robot, 
avoiding having to look for the missing Arduino one from RobotDyn that 
was used in the ShieldClon version.

The components can be SMD or THT, except for the Step-Up circuit/Lipo 
battery charge controller which is SMD,  with 1206 and 0805 components
larger than the usual 0603 and 0402).
You can an option not solder the smd components of the step-up,
and use a power bank by simply soldering the Bat-Vcc selector on the underside.
